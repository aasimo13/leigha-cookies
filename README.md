# Leigha's Cookie HQ 🍪

Enterprise-grade Girl Scout cookie storefront for Leigha.

## Quick Start

This site is hosted on GitHub Pages and uses a custom domain: **leighagrace.com**

## Admin Dashboard 🔒

**No more editing code!** Update everything through the admin dashboard.

### How to Access Admin Panel

1. Go to **leighagrace.com**
2. Scroll to the bottom footer
3. Click the green heart (💚) **5 times** quickly
4. You'll be redirected to the login page
5. Enter credentials:
   - **Username:** `aaron`
   - **Password:** `Leigha10!`

### What You Can Do in Admin

- ✅ Update cookie sales count
- ✅ Change cookie goal
- ✅ Add/remove/edit leaderboard supporters
- ✅ Changes save instantly to localStorage
- ✅ Main site updates automatically (no git push needed!)

### How It Works

The admin dashboard uses **localStorage** to store data in the browser. When you update the sales or leaderboard in the admin panel, the main site reads from localStorage and displays the updated information immediately.

**Note:** Data is stored per-browser. If you clear your browser data or switch browsers, you'll see the default values again.

### Manual Updates (Old Method)

If you prefer to edit code directly, you can still update `index.html` and push to GitHub, but the admin dashboard is much easier!
